## Background

The query trace tool helps analyze and debug query performance and correctness issues. It helps prevent
interference from external noise in a production environment (such as storage, network, etc.) by allowing
replay of a part of the query plan and dataset in an isolated environment, such as a local machine.
This is much more efficient for query performance analysis and issue debugging, as it eliminates the need
to replay the whole query in a production environment.

## How Tracing Works

The tracing process consists of two distinct phases: the tracing phase and the replaying phase. The
tracing phase is executed within a production environment, while the replaying phase is conducted in
a local development environment.

**Tracing Phase**
1. Trace replay required metadata, including the query plan fragment, query configuration,
and connectorproperties, is recorded during the query task initiation.
2. Throughout query processing, each traced operator logs the input vectors or splits
storing them in a designated storage location.
3. The metadata and splits are serialized in JSON format, and the operator data inputs are
serialized using a Presto serializer.

**Replaying Phase**
1. Read and deserialize the recorded query plan, extract the traced plan node, and assemble a plan
fragment with customized source and sink nodes.
2. The source node reads the input from the serialized operator inputs on storage and the sink operator
prints or logs out the execution stats.
3. Build a task with the assembled plan fragment in step 1. Apply the recorded query configuration and
connector properties to replay the task with the same input and configuration setup as in production.

NOTE: The presto serialization might lose input vector encoding, such as lazy vector and nested dictionary
encoding, which affects the operator’s execution. Hence, it might not always be the same as in production.

## Tracing Framework

The tracing framework consists of three components:
1. **Query Trace Writers**: records the metadata, input data, and scan splits.
2. **Query Trace Readers**: load the metadata, read input data, and scan splits.
3. **Query Trace Replayers**: display query summaries or replay the execution of the target operator.

### Trace Writers

There are three types of writers: `TaskTraceMetadataWriter`, `OperatorTraceInputWriter`,
and `OperatorTraceSplitWriter`. They are used in the prod or shadow environment to record
the real execution data.

**TaskTraceMetadataWriter**

The `TaskTraceMetadataWriter` records the query metadata during task creation, serializes it,
and saves it into a file in JSON format. There are two types of metadata:
1. Query Configurations and Connector Properties: These are user-specified per query and can
be serialized as JSON map objects (key-value pairs).
2. Task Plan Fragment (aka Plan Node Tree): This can be serialized as a JSON object, a feature
already supported in Velox (see #4614, #4301, and #4398).

The metadata is saved as a single JSON object string in the metadata file. It would look similar
to the following simplified, pretty-printed JSON string (with some content removed for brevity):

```JSON
{
  "planNode":{
    "nullAware": false,
    "outputType":{...},
    "leftKeys":[...],
    "rightKeys":[...],
    "joinType":"INNER",
    "sources":[
      {
        "outputType":{...},
        "tableHandle":{...},
        "assignments":[...],
        "id":"0",
        "name":"TableScanNode"
      },
      {
        "outputType":{...},
        "tableHandle":{...},
        "assignments":[...],
        "id":"1",
        "name":"TableScanNode"
      }
    ],
    "id":"2",
    "name":"HashJoinNode"
  },
  "connectorProperties":{...},
  "queryConfig":{"query_trace_node_ids":"2", ...}
}
```

**OperatorTraceInputWriter**

The `OperatorTraceInputWriter` records the input vectors from the target operator, it uses a Presto
serializer to serialize each vector batch and flush immediately to ensure that replay is possible
even if a crash occurs during execution.

It is created during the target operator's initialization and writes data in the `Operator::addInput`
method during execution. It finishes when the target operator is closed. However, it can finish early
if the recorded data size exceeds the limit specified by the user.

**OperatorTraceSplitWriter**

The `OperatorTraceSplitWriter` captures the input splits from the target `TableScan` operator. It
serializes each split and immediately flushes it to ensure that replay is possible even if a crash
occurs during execution.

Each split is serialized as follows:

`| length : uint32_t | split : JSON string | crc32 : uint32_t |`

### Storage Location

It is recommended to store traced data in a remote storage system to ensure its preservation and
accessibility even if the computation clusters are reconfigured or encounter issues. This also
helps prevent nodes in the cluster from failing due to local disk exhaustion.

Users should start by creating a root directory. Writers will then create subdirectories within
this root directory to organize the traced data. A well-designed directory structure will keep
the data organized and accessible for replay and analysis.

**Metadata Location**

The `TaskTraceMetadataWriter` is set up during the task creation so it creates a trace directory
named `$rootDir/$queryId/$taskId`.

**Input Data and Split Location**

The task generates Drivers and Operators, and each is identified by a set of IDs. Each Driver
is assigned a pipeline ID and a driver ID. Pipeline IDs are sequential numbers starting from zero,
and driver IDs are also sequential numbers starting from zero but are scoped to a specific pipeline,
ensuring uniqueness within that pipeline. Additionally, each operator within a driver is assigned a
sequential operator ID, starting from zero and unique within the driver.

The node ID consolidates the tracing for the same tracing plan node. The pipeline ID isolates the
tracing data between operators created from the same plan node (e.g., HashProbe and HashBuild from
the HashJoinNode). The driver ID isolates the tracing data of peer operators in the same pipeline
from different drivers.

Correspondingly, to ensure the organized and isolated tracing data storage, the `OperatorTraceInputWriter`
and `OpeartorTraceSplitWriter` are set up during the operator initialization and create a data or split
tracing directory in $rootDir/$queryId$taskId/$nodeId/$pipelineId/$driverId.

The following is a typical `HashJoinNode` traced metadata and data storage directory structure:

```SHEL
trace ---------------------------------------------------> rootDir
└── query-1 -------------------------------------------> query ID
    └── task-1 ----------------------------------------> task ID
        ├── 2 -----------------------------------------> node ID
        │   ├── 0 -------------------------> pipeline ID (probe)
        │   │   ├── 0  -------------------------> driver ID (0)
        │   │   │   ├── op_input_trace.data
        │   │   │   └── op_trace_summary.json
        │   │   └── 1  -------------------------> driver ID (1)
        │   │       ├── op_input_trace.data
        │   │       └── op_trace_summary.json
        │   └── 1  -------------------------> pipeline ID (build)
        │       ├── 0 ---------------------------> driver ID (0)
        │       │   ├── op_input_trace.data
        │       │   └── op_trace_summary.json
        │       └── 1  -------------------------> driver ID (1)
        │           ├── op_input_trace.data
        │           └── op_trace_summary.json
        └── task_trace_meta.json  ----------------> query metadata

```

### Memory Management

Add a new leaf system pool named tracePool for tracing memory usage, and expose it
like `memory::MemoryManager::getInstance()->tracePool()`.

### Trace Readers

Three types of readers correspond to the query trace writers: `TaskTraceMetadataReader`,
`OperatorTraceInputReader`, and `OperatorTraceSplitReader`. The replayers typically use
them in the local environment, which will be described in detail in the Query Trace Replayer section.

**TaskTraceMetadataReader**

The `TaskTraceMetadataReader` can load the query metadata JSON file and extract the query
configurations, connector properties, and a plan fragment. The replayer uses these to build
a replay task.

**OperatorTraceInputReader**

The `OperatorTraceInputReader` reads and deserializes the input vectors in a tracing data file.
It is created and used by a `QueryTraceScan` operator which will be described in detail in
the **Query Trace Scan** section.

**OperatorTraceSplitReader**

The `OperatorTraceSplitReader` reads and deserializes the input splits in tracing split info files,
and produces a list of `exec::Split` for the query replay.

### Trace Scan

As outlined in the **How Tracing Works** section, replaying a non-leaf operator requires a
specialized source operator. This operator is responsible for reading data records during the
tracing phase and integrating with Velox’s `LocalPlanner` with a customized plan node and
operator translator.

**TraceScanNode**

We introduce a customized ‘TraceScanNode’ to replay a non-leaf operator. This node acts as
the source node and creates a specialized scan operator, known as `OperatorTraceScan` with
one per driver during the replay. The `TraceScanNode` contains the trace directory for the
designated trace node, the pipeline ID associated with it, and a driver ID list passed during
the replaying by users so that the OperatorTraceScan can locate the right trace input data or
split directory.

**OperatorTraceScan**


As described in the **Storage Location** section, a plan node may be split into multiple pipelines,
each pipeline can be divided into multiple operators. Each operator corresponds to a driver, which
is a thread of execution. There may be multiple tracing data files for a single plan node, one file
per driver.


To identify the correct input data file associated with a specific `OperatorTraceScan` operator, it
leverages the trace node directory, pipeline ID, and driver ID list supplied by the TraceScanNode.


During the replay process, it uses its own driver ID as an index to extract the replay driver ID from
the driver ID list in the `TraceScanNode`. Along with the trace node directory and pipeline ID from
the `TraceScanNode`, it locates its corresponding input data file.


Correspondingly, an `OperatorTraceScan` operator uses a trace data file in
**$rootDir/$queryId/$taskId/$nodeId/$pipelineId/$dirverId** to create an
`OperatorTraceReader`. And `OperatorTraceScan::getOutput` method returns the vectors read by
its `OperatorTraceInputReader`, which returns the vectors in the same sequence order as originally
processed in the production execution. This ensures that the replaying maintains the same data flow
as in the original production execution.

### Query Trace Replayer

The query trace replayer is typically used in the local environment and works as follows:
1. Use `TaskTraceMetadataReader` to load traced query configurations, connector properties,
and a plan fragment.
2. Extract the target plan node from the plan fragment using the specified plan node ID.
3. Use the target plan node in step 2 to create a replay plan node. Create a replay plan
using `exec::test::PlanBuilder`.
4. If the target plan node is a `TableScanNode`
    - Add the replay plan node to the replay plan as the source node.
    - Get all the traced splits using `OperatorInputSplitReader`.
    - Use the splits as inputs for task replaying.
5. For a non-leaf operator, add a `QueryTraceScanNode` as the source node to the replay plan and
then add the replay plan node.
6. Use `exec::test::AssertQueryBuilder` to add the sink node, apply the query
configurations (disable tracing), and connector properties, and execute the replay plan.

The `OperatorReplayBase` provides the core functionality required for replaying an operator.
It handles the retrieval of metadata, creation of the replay plan, and execution of the plan.
Concrete operator replayers, such as `HashJoinReplayer` and `AggregationReplayer`, extend this
base class and override the `createPlanNode` method to create the specific plan node.

## Query Trace Tool Usage

### How To Enable Tracing

Here is the list of query configs to enable tracing in the first phase:

|Property Name|Default Value|Description|
|:-|:-:|:-|
|query_trace_enabled|false|Enable query tracing flag.|
|query_trace_dir|""|The root directory of a query to store tracing data.|
|query_trace_task_reg_exp|""|The regexp of traced task id. We only enable trace on a task if its ID matches.|
|query_trace_node_ids|""|A comma-separated list of plan node IDs whose input data will be traced. Empty string if only want to trace the query metadata.|
|query_trace_max_bytes|0|The max trace bytes limit. Tracing is disabled if zero.|

### How To Replay

After the traced query finishes, its metadata and the input data for the target tasks and operators
are all saved in the directory specified by `query_trace_dir`.

To get a glance at the traced task, we can execute the following command:

```SHELL
velox_query_replayer --root_dir /trace_root --task_id task-4 --summary
```

It would show something as follows:

```SHELL
++++++Query trace summary++++++
Number of tasks: 1

++++++Query configs++++++
	query_trace_task_reg_exp: .*
	query_trace_node_ids: 2
	query_trace_max_bytes: 107374182400
	query_trace_dir: /tmp/velox_test_aJqeFd/basic/traceRoot/
	query_trace_enabled: 1

++++++Connector configs++++++

++++++Task query plan++++++
-- HashJoin[2][INNER t0=u0] -> t0:BIGINT, t1:VARCHAR, t2:SMALLINT, t3:REAL, u0:BIGINT, u1:INTEGER, u2:SMALLINT, u3:VARCHAR
  -- TableScan[0][table: hive_table] -> t0:BIGINT, t1:VARCHAR, t2:SMALLINT, t3:REAL
  -- TableScan[1][table: hive_table] -> u0:BIGINT, u1:INTEGER, u2:SMALLINT, u3:VARCHAR

++++++Task Summaries++++++

++++++Task task-1++++++

++++++Pipeline 2++++++
driver 0: opType HashProbe, inputRows 70720, peakMemory 108.00KB
driver 1: opType HashProbe, inputRows 70720, peakMemory 108.00KB

++++++Pipeline 3++++++
driver 0: opType HashBuild, inputRows 48000, peakMemory 4.51MB
driver 1: opType HashBuild, inputRows 48000, peakMemory 2.25MB
```

Then we can execute an assembled query plan with the traced plan node using the following command in
the terminal or use the same gflags in your IDE to debug.

```SHELL
velox_query_replayer --root_dir /Users/bytedance/work/native/trace --query_id query-1 --task_id task-1 --node_id 2
```

```SHELL

```

We can replay a subset of drivers from the traced operator. For instance, if the traced operator
has 16 drivers during the tracing phase, we can selectively replay a specific driver by passing
--driver_ids, for example, `--driver_ids 1,3,5`.

Here is a full list of supported command line arguments:

|Flag|Default Value|Description|
|:-|:-:|:-|
|root_dir|""|The root directory where the replayer is reading the traced data, must be set.|
|summary|false|Show the summary of the tracing including numbers of tasks and task IDs. It also prints the query metadata including query configs, connectors properties, and query plan in JSON format.|
|query_id|""|Specify the target query ID, it must be set.|
|task_id|""|Specify the target task ID, it must be set.|
|node_id|""|Specify the target node ID, it must be set.|
|driver_ids|""|Specify the target driver IDs to replay.|
|shuffle_serialization_format|0|Specify the shuffle serialization format.|
|table_writer_output_dir|""|Specify the output directory of TableWriter.|
|hiveConnectorExecutorHwMultiplier|2.0|Hardware multiplier for hive connector.|

## Future Work

- Add support for more operators
- Customize the replay task execution instead of AssertQueryBuilder
- Supports IcebergHiveConnector
- Add trace replay for an entire pipeline
